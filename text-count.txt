I regret to inform you that I have made the difficult decision to leave practice as a primary care physician due to changes in my family situation overseas in Australia. My last day will be January 20, 2017. I sincerely apologize for any concerns this may cause; however, I can assure you that there are benefits and options in a group medical practice if a physician leaves. I am pleased to introduce a highly qualified physician has joined our office and will continue your care.

This is second attempt.
